# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cryptography Paper Template (LaTeX)

Welcome to your last excuse for formatting procrastination.

This is a battle-hardened LaTeX template for writing cryptography research papers whether you're aiming for Eurocrypt, CRYPTO, TCC, or your secret underground symposium.

Although I guess anyone can use it, the packages loaded are used more more frequently in computer science: sharp math, sane spacing, and zero tolerance for `\vspace{-0.3em}` hacks. With a tidy preamble, you can focus on breaking assumptions and proving theorems, not on fighting LaTeX into submission which I've spent so much time on (CC: Lennart).

Whether you're a seasoned IACR veteran or a first-time submitter still deciding on the color of your comments, this template has your back.

Write boldly. Typeset beautifully. May your proofs be tight and your reviewers kind.

I'm using this template from a paper we wrote with Alex, Geoffroy, and Sacha, I don't know who's responsible for what but thanks to all of them.
